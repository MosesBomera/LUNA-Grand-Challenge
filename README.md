# LUNA Grand Challenge
The [LUNA (LUng Nodule Analysis)](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/) grand challenge focused on improving lung cancer detection using automatic nodule detection algorithms on the LIDC/IDRI data set. In this end-to-end project I take on this challenge using deep learning with pytorch.
